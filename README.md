This project is created using create-react-app.
In this project I am fetching the the star wars data from https://swapi.co/people/.
After fetching the data, iterate through the data to pull out the characters names and display the same in the form of a list.
When user clicks on any one of the characters, data respect to that particular character will be displayed in the popup.
